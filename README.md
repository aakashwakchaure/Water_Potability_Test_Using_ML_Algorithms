# Water_Potability_Test_Using_ML_Algorithms
A water potability test is conducted to check if water is safe for drinking by analyzing its physical, chemical, and biological properties.

 The project aims to assess the potability (safety for drinking) of water by conducting various tests to ensure that the water is free from harmful contaminants and meets health standards.
Access to safe drinking water is fundamental to health, recognized as a basic human right and a cornerstone of effective health protection policies. It plays a critical role in both health and development, impacting individuals and communities at national, regional, and local levels. In many regions, investing in water supply and sanitation has proven to deliver significant economic benefits. The reduction in health risks and associated healthcare costs far exceeds the costs of implementing these interventions, making it not only a health priority but also a sound economic strategy.
